# How to improve our everyday thinking


" Pick a few areas and pick a few things where you want to change what you're doing. Focus on those.
I mean, do not expect that you can generally increase the quality of your thinking because I think you really cannot.
If there are repetitive mistakes that you're prone to make, if you learn the cues, the situations in which you make that mistake,
then maybe you can learn to eliminate them". (Daniel Kahneman)
